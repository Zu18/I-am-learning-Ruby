Ifã€€a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26
Then l + o + v + e = 54
and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108

Your task is to write a function which calculates the value of a word based off the sum of the alphabet positions of its characters.
The input will always be made of only lowercase letters and will never be empty.
